    To play, enter the coordinates of the point in the ocean you wish to drop
    a sonar device. The sonar can find out how far away the closest chest is to
    it.

    For example, the d below marks where the device was dropped, and the 2's represent distances of 2 away from the device.
    The 4's represent distances of 4 away from the device.
